# Test Document for LangChain

This is a test document to verify that LangChain text splitters are working properly.

## Section 1: Introduction

This section contains introductory content about the document processing capabilities.

## Section 2: Code Example

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello from LangChain!")
    return "success"
