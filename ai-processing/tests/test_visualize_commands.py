"""Placeholder module for future visualize CLI tests.

The visualize command group is currently exercised indirectly via unit
tests on the underlying helpers. CLI-level tests will be added once the
import/package layout is simplified to avoid name clashes between the
top-level ``cli`` entry point and the ``src.cli`` package.
