# TurndownService Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The error
`MarkdownConverter: TurndownService not available, attempting to load library dynamically`
was occurring because:

1. The `turndown.min.js` library was listed as a web-accessible resource in
   `manifest.json`
2. But it wasn't being loaded by the content script
3. The complex dynamic loading logic was failing

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Manifest V3 Configuration

Modified `manifest.json` to include `turndown.min.js` directly in the content
script injection:

```json
"content_scripts": [
  {
    "matches": ["<all_urls>"],
    "js": ["libs/turndown.min.js", "content/content-script.js"],
    "run_at": "document_idle"
  }
]
```

### 2. Simplified MarkdownConverter Initialization

- Removed complex dynamic loading methods (`loadTurndownService`,
  `tryAlternativeLoading`)
- Simplified initialization to directly check for `window.TurndownService`
- Removed `_initializationPromise` field and related async complexity
- Added proper fallback when TurndownService is not available

### 3. Key Changes Made

1. **manifest.json**: Added `libs/turndown.min.js` to content script injection
2. **markdown-converter.ts**: Simplified initialization logic
3. **Error handling**: Better fallback to built-in conversion when library
   unavailable

## Testing Results

- ✅ Build completed successfully
- ✅ All existing tests pass (24/24)
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ Proper fallback behavior maintained

## Next Steps

1. Load the extension in Chrome/Edge developer mode
2. Navigate to `test-page.html`
3. Test page capture with Ctrl+Shift+S
4. Verify no TurndownService errors in console
5. Confirm markdown conversion works properly

The fix ensures TurndownService loads reliably in Manifest V3 extensions while
maintaining backwards compatibility and proper error handling.
