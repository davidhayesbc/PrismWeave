# TurndownService Integration Fix

## Issue
The browser extension was showing the error "TurndownService not available, using enhanced fallback conversion" because the TurndownService library was not being properly loaded into the content script context.

## Root Cause
1. The `turndown` library was installed as a dependency but not being made available to content scripts
2. The manifest.json referenced a non-existent `libs/turndown.min.js` file
3. The service worker was not injecting the TurndownService library before injecting the content script

## Solution Applied

### 1. Library Setup
- Copied `node_modules/turndown/dist/turndown.js` to `src/libs/turndown.min.js`
- Updated the build script to copy the `src/libs` directory to `dist/libs`
- Updated manifest.json to include only the actual library file in web_accessible_resources

### 2. Service Worker Enhancement
- Modified `ensureContentScriptInjected()` function to inject TurndownService library first
- Added proper error handling for library injection
- Enhanced content script injection with dependency management

### 3. Markdown Converter Improvements
- Updated TurndownService detection to check both `window.TurndownService` and `globalThis.TurndownService`
- Improved fallback conversion when TurndownService is not available
- Added better logging for debugging TurndownService availability

## Files Modified
1. `scripts/build-simple.js` - Added libs directory copying
2. `manifest.json` - Updated web_accessible_resources
3. `src/background/service-worker.ts` - Enhanced content script injection
4. `src/utils/markdown-converter.ts` - Improved TurndownService detection
5. `src/libs/turndown.min.js` - Added TurndownService library

## Result
- TurndownService is now properly available to content scripts
- High-quality HTML to Markdown conversion using TurndownService
- Graceful fallback to enhanced conversion when TurndownService fails to load
- Better error handling and logging throughout the conversion process

## Testing
The extension builds successfully and should now provide much better HTML to Markdown conversion quality when capturing web pages.

## Future Improvements
- Consider bundling TurndownService directly into the content script build
- Add comprehensive tests for TurndownService integration
- Implement performance monitoring for conversion quality
