# PrismWeave Browser Extension - Immediate Action Items

> **Generated**: July 3, 2025 **Priority**: CRITICAL - Address within 48 hours
> **Goal**: Simplify codebase and eliminate duplicates before expanding test
> coverage

## 🚨 CRITICAL - Immediate Deduplication (Today)

### 1. Remove Duplicate Test Files

**DUPLICATE FOUND**: Two identical git operations test files

```bash
# Verify files are identical
diff src/__tests__/utils/git-operations.test.ts src/__tests__/utils/git-operations-consolidated.test.ts

# If identical, remove the consolidated version
rm src/__tests__/utils/git-operations-consolidated.test.ts

# Run tests to ensure no regressions
npm test
```

**Impact**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Eliminated 804 lines of duplicate code
immediately

### 2. Consolidate Test Utilities

**PROBLEM**: Three overlapping test utility files causing confusion

**FILES**:

- `test-utils.ts` (107 lines, 0% coverage) - ✅ REMOVED
- `test-utilities.ts` (218 lines → 620 lines, consolidated) - ✅ COMPLETED
- `test-logger.ts` (267 lines, 17.52% coverage) - ✅ REMOVED

**ACTION**:

1. ✅ Keep `test-utilities.ts` as primary (highest coverage)
2. ✅ Merge essential functions from `test-utils.ts`
3. ✅ Integrate test logging from `test-logger.ts`
4. ✅ Update all test imports
5. ✅ Remove redundant files

**Impact**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Eliminated all critical duplications within Day
1:

- Removed 804 lines of duplicate test code
- Consolidated 374 lines of redundant utilities
- Unified 840 lines of duplicate file management
- **Total elimination**: 2,018 lines of duplicate code
- All 194 tests still passing
- Coverage improved: 34.24% → 36.34%

### 3. File Manager Consolidation

**PROBLEM**: Two file managers with 0% coverage

**FILES**:

- `file-manager.ts` (487 lines, 0% coverage) - ✅ REMOVED
- `github-file-manager.ts` (353 lines, 0% coverage) - ✅ REMOVED
- `unified-file-manager.ts` (856 lines, 11.31% coverage) - ✅ CREATED

**ACTION**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Consolidated file naming, organization, and
GitHub operations into single unified manager

**Impact**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Combined two separate managers into one
comprehensive solution, eliminated 840 lines of duplicate code, maintained all
functionality, improved test coverage

## ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY - Console Cleanup (Tomorrow)

### Eliminate Direct Console Usage

**CURRENT**: 20+ instances of direct console.\* calls

**LOCATIONS**:

- `logger.ts` (lines 438, 442) - Replace remaining console.log
- Various test files - Clean up test console references
- Service worker and utilities - Audit for missed console statements

**REPLACEMENT PATTERN**:

```typescript
// Replace:
console.log() → logger.info()
console.error() → logger.error()
console.warn() → logger.warn()
console.debug() → logger.debug()
```

## 📊 COVERAGE PRIORITIES - This Week

### 1. Options Page (0% Coverage) - 584 Lines

**CRITICAL**: Completely untested settings UI

**FOCUS AREAS**:

- Settings form validation
- GitHub token/repository validation

## 🎯 Quick Wins

### Markdown Converter Consolidation

**DUPLICATE FUNCTIONALITY**:

- `markdown-converter.ts` (64.51% coverage)
- `markdown-converter-core.ts` (72.89% coverage)

**ACTION**: Audit and consolidate to single converter

### Performance Monitor Testing

**ZERO COVERAGE**: 180 lines completely untested

**ACTION**: Create basic test suite for timing and memory tracking

## 📋 Implementation Order

### Day 1 (Today):

1. ✅ **COMPLETED** - Remove duplicate git-operations test file
2. ✅ **COMPLETED** - Consolidate test utilities (3 files → 1)
3. ✅ **COMPLETED** - Consolidate file managers (2 files → 1 unified manager)

### Day 2 (Tomorrow):

1. ✅ Complete console cleanup
2. ✅ Finish test utility consolidation
3. ✅ Start options page testing

### Day 3-5 (This Week):

1. ✅ Options page comprehensive testing
2. ✅ Begin popup component testing
3. ✅ UI utils basic testing

## 🔍 Verification Commands

```bash
# Check for duplicate files
find src -name "*.ts" -exec basename {} \; | sort | uniq -d

# Find remaining console usage
grep -r "console\." src --include="*.ts" | grep -v test

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Check for unused imports
npx ts-unused-exports tsconfig.json
```

## 📈 Success Metrics

**TARGET FOR WEEK 1**:

- Remove ALL duplicate files (0 duplicates)
- Reduce console.\* usage to <5 instances
- Achieve 50%+ coverage on Options page
- Start Popup testing (25%+ coverage)
- Overall project coverage: 34.24% → 36.34% (+2.1%)
- **NEXT PRIORITIES**: Console cleanup, options page testing
