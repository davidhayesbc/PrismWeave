- [ ] **Action Required**: Remove `git-operations-consolidated.test.ts`
      (identical file)
- [ ] **Verify**: Ensure all test cases are in main `git-operations.test.ts`
- [ ] **Test**: Run tests to confirm no regressions

### 1.2 File Manager Consolidation

**Problem**: Two file managers with overlapping GitHub functionality

#### Current State:

- `FileManager` (487 lines, 0% coverage) - Generic file operations
- `GitHubFileManager` (Unknown size, 0% coverage) - GitHub-specific operations

#### Action Plan:

- [ ] **Audit**: Compare functionality between FileManager and GitHubFileManager
- [ ] **Consolidate**: Merge into single GitHubFileManager with proper
      abstraction

- `test-logger.ts` (267 lines, 17.52% coverage) - Test logging functionality

#### Consolidation Strategy:

- [ ] **Keep**: `test-utilities.ts` as primary (highest coverage, comprehensive)
- [ ] **Merge**: Move essential functions from `test-utils.ts` into
      `test-utilities.ts`
- [ ] **Integrate**: Move test logging functions into main test utilities
- [ ] **Remove**: Delete `test-utils.ts` and `test-logger.ts` after merge
- [ ] **Update imports**: Update all test files to use consolidated utilities

```typescript
// Replace Pattern:
console.log() ‚Üí logger.info()
console.error() ‚Üí logger.error()
console.warn() ‚Üí logger.warn()
console.debug() ‚Üí logger.debug()
```
