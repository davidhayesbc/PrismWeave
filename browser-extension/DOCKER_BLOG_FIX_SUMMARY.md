# Docker Blog Content Extraction Fix

## Problem Identified

Based on your log output, the issue was **selector priority**. The extension was
choosing the `main` element (32,494 chars) instead of the much more focused
`.entry-content` element (30,457 chars) which contains the actual blog content.

The massive content loss (86,295 → 4,340 → 707 chars) was happening because:

1. ❌ `main` element was selected (includes navigation, sidebars, etc.)
2. ❌ Aggressive cleaning removed most content as "unwanted"
3. ❌ Only a tiny fraction of actual article content remained

## Fix Applied

### 1. Updated Selector Priority

**Before** (problematic order):

```typescript
'article',
  'main',
  '[role="main"]',
  '.content',
  '.post-content',
  '.entry-content';
```

**After** (fixed order):

```typescript
'.entry-content',
  '.post-content',
  '.article-content',
  '.blog-content',
  'article',
  'main';
```

### 2. Enhanced Debugging

- Added detailed logging in markdown converter
- Shows content length at each processing step
- Helps identify where content loss occurs

## Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Load Updated Extension

1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Click "Reload" on the PrismWeave extension
3. Or load unpacked from `browser-extension/dist/`

### Step 2: Test on Docker Blog

1. Navigate to:
   `https://www.docker.com/blog/how-to-make-ai-chatbot-from-scratch/`
2. Open browser console (F12)

### Step 3: Run Complete Test

Copy and paste this script in the console:

```javascript
// Copy the entire content from complete-extension-test.js
```

### Step 4: Run Content Loss Analysis (if needed)

If still having issues, also run:

```javascript
// Copy the entire content from docker-content-loss-analysis.js
```

## Expected Results

With the fix, you should now see:

- ✅ `.entry-content` selected instead of `main`
- ✅ ~30,000 characters of content preserved
- ✅ Markdown output of 3,000+ characters (not 707)
- ✅ Proper article headings and content
- ✅ Docker/AI chatbot related content preserved

## If Still Having Issues

### Check Console Output For:

1. **Selector being used**: Should show `.entry-content` selected
2. **Content lengths**: Input → Preprocessed → Raw Markdown → Final
3. **Any error messages**: In markdown conversion

### Possible Additional Issues:

1. **TurndownService not loading**: Would fall back to basic conversion
2. **Aggressive post-processing**: Removing too much content
3. **Character encoding**: Issues with special characters

### Next Steps:

1. Run the test scripts and share the console output
2. Look for any error messages in the conversion process
3. Check if the markdown contains the expected Docker blog content

The selector priority fix should resolve the main content loss issue. The
`.entry-content` div contains the actual WordPress post content without
navigation/sidebar bloat.
