# Markdown Conversion Improvements

## Overview

The markdown conversion system has been significantly enhanced to provide much higher fidelity when converting web pages to markdown format. These improvements address common issues with content loss, poor formatting, and missing semantic information.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Content Extraction

**Selective Content Removal**: The content extractor is now much more selective about what gets removed, preserving valuable content that might have been incorrectly filtered out before.

**Semantic Structure Enhancement**: The system now:
- Converts semantic div elements to appropriate HTML tags (e.g., quote divs â†’ blockquotes)
- Creates figure elements for images with captions
- Preserves definition lists and other structured content
- Maintains important semantic classes and attributes

**Better Unwanted Content Detection**: More sophisticated filtering that:
- Preserves article comments vs. generic comments
- Keeps content-related sidebars and asides
- Maintains author information and metadata
- Protects structured content even in navigation-like containers

### 2. Advanced Markdown Conversion

**Enhanced Code Block Handling**: 
- Advanced language detection from multiple sources (classes, data attributes, content analysis)
- Proper indentation preservation
- Support for common language aliases and normalization

**Improved Table Conversion**:
- Better header detection (thead vs th elements)
- Column alignment preservation
- Enhanced cell content processing with markdown formatting
- Proper escaping of pipe characters

**Rich Content Support**:
- Figure and caption handling
- Definition lists conversion
- Callout and note box detection
- Enhanced blockquotes with attribution
- Preservation of formatting elements (sub, sup, mark, del, ins)

**Advanced Link Processing**:
- Better title attribute handling
- Email link detection
- Anchor link preservation
- URL validation and resolution

### 3. Intelligent Content Preprocessing

**Context-Aware Cleaning**: The system now:
- Preserves semantic HTML elements that should be kept
- Maintains important attributes for accessibility and structure
- Selectively removes style information while keeping semantic classes
- Protects valuable content from aggressive filtering

**Enhanced HTML Entity Handling**: Proper conversion of:
- Common typography entities (em dash, en dash, curly quotes)
- Mathematical and special symbols
- Whitespace and formatting entities

### 4. Improved Fallback System

**Enhanced Fallback Conversion**: When TurndownService isn't available, the system uses:
- Advanced regex patterns for better HTML parsing
- Intelligent language detection for code blocks
- Proper table structure recognition
- Enhanced formatting preservation

**Better Error Handling**: 
- Graceful degradation when external libraries fail
- Multiple fallback layers for conversion
- Detailed error logging for debugging

## Technical Features

### Language Detection
The system can detect programming languages from:
- CSS classes (`language-js`, `brush-python`, etc.)
- Data attributes (`data-lang`, `data-language`)
- Content analysis (function keywords, syntax patterns)
- File extension hints

### Content Quality Assessment
Enhanced content scoring that considers:
- Semantic structure (headers, lists, etc.)
- Media richness (images, videos)
- Link density and quality
- Reading flow and paragraph structure

### Accessibility Preservation
- ARIA labels and descriptions maintained
- Semantic role attributes preserved
- Language and direction information kept
- Screen reader friendly content structure

## Configuration Options

The enhanced converter supports:
- Custom semantic selectors for better content detection
- Configurable unwanted content filters
- Language detection customization
- Output formatting preferences

## Usage Examples

### Before Enhancement
```markdown
# Some Title
This is content with poor formatting and missing links.
Code blocks had no language information.
Tables were poorly formatted.
```

### After Enhancement
```markdown
# Some Title

This is content with **proper formatting** and [preserved links](https://example.com).

```javascript
function example() {
  // Code blocks now have proper language detection
  return "enhanced conversion";
}
```

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Data     | More     | Content  |

> **Note:** Callouts and special content are now properly preserved with enhanced formatting.

```

## Performance Considerations

- The enhanced conversion adds minimal overhead
- Fallback systems ensure reliability even without external dependencies
- Content analysis is optimized for speed
- Memory usage is kept minimal through selective processing

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:
- Mathematical equation preservation (MathML/LaTeX)
- Enhanced multimedia content handling
- Custom markdown extensions support
- Export format options (CommonMark, GitHub Flavored Markdown, etc.)
