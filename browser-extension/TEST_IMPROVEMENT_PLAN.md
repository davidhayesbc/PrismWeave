## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Changes

- [ ] **Service Worker Refactoring**: Create backup of existing tests before
      replacing
- [ ] **Mock Reduction**: Gradual transition, maintain fallbacks for critical
      paths
- [ ] **Integration Testing**: Start with simple scenarios, add complexity
      incrementally

### Testing Strategy

- [ ] **Incremental Implementation**: One component at a time
- [ ] **Continuous Validation**: Run tests after each change
- [ ] **Rollback Plan**: Keep original test files until new ones are stable

## Notes and Considerations

### Development Guidelines

- **Test-Driven Approach**: Write tests for new functionality before
  implementation
- **Real Code Priority**: Test actual business logic whenever possible
- **Mock Judiciously**: Mock only external dependencies and Chrome APIs
- **Documentation**: Update test documentation as we improve coverage

### Browser Extension Specific Considerations

- **Chrome API Limitations**: Some APIs require real browser environment
- **Message Passing**: Test async communication patterns thoroughly
- **Storage Limitations**: Test quota and performance constraints
- **Content Script Isolation**: Test cross-context communication

## Getting Started

To begin implementation:

1. **Review Current Tests**: Understand existing test patterns and coverage gaps
2. **Start with Phase 1**: Low-risk consolidation to reduce duplication
3. **Incremental Progress**: Complete one checkbox at a time
4. **Continuous Validation**: Run test suite after each major change
5. **Documentation**: Update this plan as we discover new requirements

**Ready to proceed with Phase 1? Let's start with consolidating the settings
manager tests!**
