  `getTurndownLibrary` etc.

**Test Results**:

```
âœ“ SW.1.4 - Should handle storage errors gracefully (30 ms)
âœ“ SW.3.1 - Should fetch TurndownService library successfully (31 ms)

## Notes and Considerations

### Development Guidelines

- **Test-Driven Approach**: Write tests for new functionality before
  implementation
- **Real Code Priority**: Test actual business logic whenever possible
- **Mock Judiciously**: Mock only external dependencies and Chrome APIs
- **Documentation**: Update test documentation as we improve coverage

### Browser Extension Specific Considerations

- **Chrome API Limitations**: Some APIs require real browser environment
- **Message Passing**: Test async communication patterns thoroughly
- **Storage Limitations**: Test quota and performance constraints
- **Content Script Isolation**: Test cross-context communication

## Getting Started

To begin implementation:

1. **Review Current Tests**: Understand existing test patterns and coverage gaps
2. **Start with Phase 1**: Low-risk consolidation to reduce duplication
3. **Incremental Progress**: Complete one checkbox at a time
4. **Continuous Validation**: Run test suite after each major change
5. **Documentation**: Update this plan as we discover new requirements

**Ready to proceed with Phase 1? Let's start with consolidating the settings
manager tests!**
