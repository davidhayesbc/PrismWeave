## ðŸŽ‰ Your Local Bookmarklet Development Environment is Ready!

### What You Have Now

âœ… **Local Development Server** running at http://localhost:8080 âœ…
**Bookmarklet Generator** with testing capabilities âœ… **Debug Tools** for
analyzing and troubleshooting âœ… **Built-in Test Content** for verification

### Quick Start Guide

1. **The server is already running** - you should see it opened in your browser

   - If not, go to: http://localhost:8080/local-bookmarklet-generator.html

2. **Fill in your GitHub settings:**

   - GitHub Personal Access Token (get from https://github.com/settings/tokens)
   - Your repository name (format: `username/repo-name`)
   - Choose your preferences for folder and file naming

3. **Generate your bookmarklet:**

   - Click "Generate Bookmarklet"
   - Drag the generated bookmarklet to your browser's bookmarks bar

4. **Test it works:**
   - Click "Test on This Page" button
   - Or switch to the "Test Page" tab for comprehensive testing
   - Check the "Debug Tools" tab to see what content is extracted

### What's Different from Before

- âœ… **No deployment needed** - everything runs locally
- âœ… **Instant testing** - test your bookmarklets immediately
- âœ… **Real debugging** - see exactly what content gets extracted
- âœ… **GitHub API validation** - verify your token works before testing
- âœ… **Compact bookmarklets** - ~1000 characters instead of 2000+

### To Stop the Server

Press `Ctrl+C` in the PowerShell terminal when you're done testing.

### To Restart Later

Just run the command again:

```powershell
.\dev-tools\start-local-dev.ps1
```

### Files Created

- `local-bookmarklet-generator.html` - Complete standalone generator
- `start-local-dev.ps1` - Server startup script
- `LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md` - Detailed documentation
- `index.html` - Simple navigation page

### Next Steps

1. Test your bookmarklet generation locally
2. Verify it works with the built-in test content
3. Try it on real websites once you're confident it's working
4. Use the debug tools to fine-tune content extraction if needed

Happy bookmarklet development! ðŸš€
