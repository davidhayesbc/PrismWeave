# DocTracker Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (for toolbar)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (for extension management)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (for extension management)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (for Chrome Web Store)

## Design Guidelines

The DocTracker icon should represent:
- Document capture/collection
- Clean, modern design
- Uses brand colors (blue #2196F3, green #4CAF50)
- Simple geometric shapes that scale well

## Icon Concepts

1. **Document with Arrow**: A document icon with a downward arrow indicating capture
2. **Folder with Plus**: A folder icon with a plus sign indicating document collection
3. **Page with Bookmark**: A page icon with a bookmark corner indicating saved content

## Creating Icons

Use tools like:
- Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop
- Figma
- GIMP (free)
- Online icon generators

Export as PNG files with transparent backgrounds.

## Temporary Solution

For development/testing purposes, you can use placeholder icons or generate simple colored squares using online tools until proper icons are designed.
