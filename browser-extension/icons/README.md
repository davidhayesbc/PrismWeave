- Blue (#2196F3) for the document border and primary elements
- Green (#4CAF50) for the capture/download indicator
- Simple geometric shapes that scale well across all sizes

## Current Icons

The current icons feature:
- A document with a folded corner (representing web pages)
- Horizontal lines indicating content
- A green circular arrow icon in the bottom-right (representing capture/download)
- Clean, scalable design that works at all sizes

## Icon Concepts

1. **Document with Arrow**: A document icon with a downward arrow indicating capture
2. **Folder with Plus**: A folder icon with a plus sign indicating document collection
3. **Page with Bookmark**: A page icon with a bookmark corner indicating saved content

## Creating Icons

Use tools like:
- Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop
- Figma
- GIMP (free)
- Online icon generators

Export as PNG files with transparent backgrounds.

## Temporary Solution

For development/testing purposes, you can use placeholder icons or generate simple colored squares using online tools until proper icons are designed.
