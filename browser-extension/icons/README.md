## Design Guidelines

The PrismWeave icon represents:

- Document capture/collection with a clean document icon
- Modern flat design with PrismWeave brand colors
- Blue (#2196F3) for the document border and primary elements
- Green (#4CAF50) for the capture/download indicator
- Simple geometric shapes that scale well across all sizes

## Current Icons

The current icons feature:

- A document with a folded corner (representing web pages)
- Horizontal lines indicating content
- A green circular arrow icon in the bottom-right (representing
  capture/download)
- Clean, scalable design that works at all sizes

The icons are provided in PNG format at the following sizes:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (Windows taskbar, Mac dock)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store, installation)

## Icon Concepts

1. **Document with Arrow**: A document icon with a downward arrow indicating
   capture
2. **Folder with Plus**: A folder icon with a plus sign indicating document
   collection
3. **Page with Bookmark**: A page icon with a bookmark corner indicating saved
   content

## Creating Icons

Use tools like:

- Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop
- Figma
- GIMP (free)
- Online icon generators

Export as PNG files with transparent backgrounds.

## Temporary Solution

For development/testing purposes, you can use placeholder icons or generate
simple colored squares using online tools until proper icons are designed.
