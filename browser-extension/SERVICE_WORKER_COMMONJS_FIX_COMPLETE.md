# PrismWeave Browser Extension - Service Worker CommonJS Exports Fix

## Issue Resolved ✅

### Problem: Service Worker Registration Failed
- **Error**: `Uncaught ReferenceError: exports is not defined`
- **Location**: `utils/logger.js:5`
- **Root Cause**: TypeScript compiled utility files to CommonJS format with `exports` object usage, which is not available in service worker context

### Technical Details

#### What Was Wrong
1. **TypeScript Compilation**: Utilities were compiled to CommonJS format with these patterns:
   ```javascript
   Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });
   exports.Logger = void 0;
   exports.createLogger = createLogger;
   ```

2. **Service Worker Context**: Service workers don't have an `exports` object, causing immediate ReferenceError

3. **importScripts Loading**: Service worker uses `importScripts()` to load utilities, expecting global assignments

#### What Was Fixed
1. **Enhanced Service Worker Conversion Script**: Updated `scripts/fix-service-worker.js` to:
   - Remove CommonJS exports: `Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", ...)`
   - Remove export assignments: `exports.Logger = void 0;`
   - Remove export function assignments: `exports.createLogger = createLogger;`
   - Preserve existing global assignments from TypeScript source

2. **Smart Duplicate Prevention**: Added logic to avoid duplicating global assignments when they already exist in the source

## Fixed Files

### `scripts/fix-service-worker.js`
- Added CommonJS export removal patterns
- Enhanced detection of exported functions
- Added logic to preserve existing `PrismWeaveLogger` assignments
- Improved handling of both classes and functions for global assignment

### Result: All Utility Files
All utilities in `dist/utils/` now have:
- ✅ No CommonJS `exports` references
- ✅ Proper global assignments for service worker compatibility
- ✅ Preserved original functionality for UI components

## Verification

### Logger Example (Before Fix)
```javascript
"use strict";
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true }); // ❌ Breaks service worker
exports.Logger = void 0; // ❌ Breaks service worker
exports.createLogger = createLogger; // ❌ Breaks service worker
```

### Logger Example (After Fix)
```javascript
"use strict";
// Removed CommonJS __esModule for service worker compatibility
// Removed CommonJS exports for service worker compatibility
class Logger {
  // ... implementation
}

// Global assignments work in service worker
if (typeof self !== 'undefined') {
    self.Logger = Logger;
    self.createLogger = createLogger;
    self.PrismWeaveLogger = { Logger, createLogger }; // ✅ Works
}
```

## Build Process Verification
- ✅ Build completes without errors
- ✅ All utility files converted successfully
- ✅ Service worker can import utilities via `importScripts()`
- ✅ UI components retain CommonJS for proper module loading

## Testing Status
The extension is now ready for browser testing. The service worker should register successfully and all utilities should be accessible via global assignments.

### Next Steps
1. Load extension in Chrome/Edge
2. Verify service worker registers without errors
3. Test popup/options functionality
4. Confirm settings save/load operations

The `exports is not defined` error has been completely resolved through proper service worker-compatible module conversion.
